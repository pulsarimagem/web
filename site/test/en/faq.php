					<h3>Search</h3>
There are 2 ways of searching:
<br /><br />

Keyword <br />
Type in the keyword that you wish to search and confirm. The search results will soon appear, mentioning the search terms and the number of images found.
You can choose the number of pictures you want to be shown on each page, and see your search through thumbnails or larger size pictures, with all tags of each images.
<br /><br />Code<br />
If you know the identification code of the image you wish to see, all you need to do is type in the code in the right field and confirm. If you type in the wrong code, the system will show you an error message. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Categories</h3>
We created a categorie selection to make your searches easier. Mouse over them and the categories will appear. Click on them and the related pictures will appear.<br />
                 When you select the wider term of the category, the search results will be all the images related. When you choose a subdivision, however, you will get more specified results.<br />
  For example, if you click on “nature – national parks” you will see all the images related to national parks. But if you choose “nature – national parks – National Park of Iguacu (PR) you will see only pictures of this park.
<br /><br />
			</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Advanced Search</h3>
This section allows you to make more refined searches. We make available several search tools that combined can lead to more specific results. <br />
  Using the “and” option, you can make a search by the addition of 2 or more terms. For example: soy “and” harvest – the results will show only pictures of soy harvesting, and no pictures of general harvesting or soy beans. <br />
  If you choose, for example, the “does not contain the word” option, you can search like soy “does not contain the word” harvest. And the results will show you all soy pictures, but none of soy harvesting. <br />
You can also combine subject and author, so you can see only the pictures of one author about that subject.<br />
If you choose only the author, you will see all pictures from that photographer.<br />
You can also search by picture orientation, vertical or horizontal.<br />
You can use all the fields by themselves or combined – the way you use the fields will determine the results of the search.
